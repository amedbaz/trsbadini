 "akurti":"summer, warmest season of the year, between spring and autumn. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is usually defined as the period between the summer solstice (yearâ€™s longest day), June 21 or 22, and the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in length), September 22 or 23; and in the Southern Hemisphere, as the period between December 22 or 23 and March 20 or 21. The temperature contrast between summer and the other seasons exists only in middle and high latitudes; temperatures in the equatorial regions generally vary little from month to month. For physical causes of the seasons, see season.",

 "akurti":"How do clouds float?How do clouds float?And how much does a cloud weigh?See all videos for this articleConcentrations of raindrops typically range from 100 to 1,000 per cubic m (3 to 30 per cubic foot); drizzle droplets usually are more numerous. Raindrops seldom have diameters larger than 4 mm, because as they increase in size they break up. The concentration generally decreases as diameters increase. Except when the rain is heavy, it does not reduce visibility as much as does drizzle. Meteorologists classify rain according to its rate of fall. The hourly rates relating to light, moderate, and heavy rain are, respectively, less than 2.5 mm, 2.8 to 7.6 mm, and more than 7.6 mm.",

 "akurti":"Snow cover has a significant effect on climate and on plant, animal, and human life. By increasing the reflection of solar radiation and interfering with the conduction of heat from the ground, it induces a cold climate. The low heat conduction protects small plants from the effects of the lowest winter temperatures; on the other hand, the late disappearance of snow in the spring delays the growth of plants. When snow melts in the spring, the resulting runoff feeds rivers and supplies water for irrigation and other human enterprises. Heavy snowfalls can severely hinder transporation in variable moderate climates but provides a firm surface for travel in remote Arctic, Antarctic, and mountainous areas, using traditional dogsleds or snowshoes or modern snowmobiles.",
